# keeper-of-the-seven-keys-game

Undergrad coursework game based on the song by German band Helloween.

Unfortunately I do not own the code that the Professor used for the engine, so I'm only sharing the binaries and the game design document (in Brazilian Portuguese).
Also, I'm adding all the assets that I have used with their respective sources for the ones I haven't created myself.

This game is intended to run on Windows systems.
